# Arduino-IR-Receiver-PS2-Remote-RGB-LED-One-Digit-Seven-Segment-Display
Programmed an Arduino to receive code through an IR receiver with a PS2 Remote and activate LEDS
•	Depending on the button that was pressed on the remote, it corresponded to the case programmed into the Arduino which would activate the RGB LED to show a certain color
•	For example, Circle would be Red, Square would be Purple
•	I created lighting modes to choose from with the usage of the Display
•	The display would have modes from “0-9” to choose from which would light up the RGB LED in different colors through a case by case basis.
